# Blocks Libraries

MOKAStudio can export/import any single block as JSON file, but you can also export a complete library.

A Blocks Library is a collection of blocks of the same category (widgets, pages, etc.).

## Export Library

Select a blocks category and click the button <button style="background:#63b3ed;color:white;padding:2px 4px">Export</button>

## Import Library

Select any blocks category and click the button <button style="background:#63b3ed;color:white;padding:2px 4px">Import</button>

Select your blocks file save with previous export.

MOKAStudio will automatically recognize the library category and how many blocks to import.

Confirm the import and you now have your blocks loaded in MOKAStudio.

> to refresh click again on the blocks category you have imported.

You can contribute creating your own libraries and share with other MOKAStudio users.
